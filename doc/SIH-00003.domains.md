# Solution domains

Domain are used to separate different solutions for same device in same repo
Default domain is root domain with name "/". But in tag such name is simply empty.

## Rules ##

- Domain in web showed after software type
- Root domain hame empty name (like "not showed at all")
- For concrete device item show domain of last installed version of sw.
- "For all" and "Order" items must be showed for each existen sub domain 

    For example if there are only tags in repo:

        1 PROD/DEVICE_A/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/DOMAIN_A/DOMAIN_B/DOMAIN_C
        2 PROD/DEVICE_A/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/DOMAIN_A

    then there must be in web:
    
        For all | DOMAIN_A/DOMAIN_B/DOMAIN_C
        For all | DOMAIN_A
        
    note: root domain not found and not displayed
    
- Metric for tag with domain must be calculated to base version in same domain, in in same super domain, and so on up till root domain.

    For example if there are only tags in repo:

        1 PROD/DEVICE_A/ITEM-000X/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/DOMAIN_A/DOMAIN_B/DOMAIN_C
        2 PROD/DEVICE_A/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/DOMAIN_A
        3 PROD/DEVICE_A/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM/

    Metric for [1] must be calculated relative to [2] (nearest subdomain item)
