# Metrics

Metric for tags A and B for one device class defined as
 
    def: INST(A, B) - install date and time diff:       -,0,+     A < B => "-",  A = B => "0"  A > B "+"    A relative to B
    def: DIST(A, B) - direct path commits count diff: x,-,0,+ 
    
    Values:
    
        -   : lesser
        0   : equals
        +   : greater
        *   : any
        x   : not exist
    
    def: DIST(A, B) = x   =>   A and B in different branches without direct way to each other
    
    ISB - [I]tem [S]pecific [B]ranch name is in form "release/<device_class>/item-<id>"
        
    if A in ISB              : x => DIST(A, B) = '+'
    if A in any other branch : x => DIST(A, B) = '-'

    DI(A, B)   B - is the BASE commit, A - testable, D - DIST, I - INST

        <RES> ::= 
            OK     |    A new            (green)

            OLD         A old            (red)
            
    d - days between commits     (positive is A > B)
    c - commits between commits  (positive is A > B)

    for "item" or "order" lines -> A is line version, B - base version
    for "all versions" lines -> A is line version, B - latest installed version to specific device
